### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE6/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested: Conciseness, Readability, Complete Beginner. Do I easily want to read this and do I understand this? 
      Answer: No, this is exceedingly boring and I'd rather not read this. Not to mention, this is assuming that I'm not a complete beginner to cars. I know next to nothing about cars, so the "simple terms" would not be simple for me
      Chat Response: Of course! Object-oriented programming is a way of writing computer programs by organizing code into "objects" that represent real-world things or concepts.

Imagine you have a car. In object-oriented programming, you would create an "object" called Car that has properties like color, model, and speed, and behaviors like starting the engine or changing gears.

These objects can interact with each other, like a Car object interacting with a Driver object. This makes it easier to manage and understand the code because you can break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts.

So, in simple terms, object-oriented programming is like building with Lego blocks - you create different pieces (objects) that fit together to create a bigger structure (program). It helps make coding more organized, flexible, and easier to work with.
           
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Conciseness, Well organized, easy to read
      Answer: No, this failed yet again. A summary of the key points would have an order involved to make it more easy to read. The key points would be bolded, with supporting details after that.
     Chat Response: Of course! The paragraph describes a time of contrasts and extremes, highlighting the duality of the era with phrases like "best of times" and "worst of times," "age of wisdom" and "age of foolishness." It emphasizes the conflicting nature of the period, where there is hope and despair, light and darkness. The passage suggests that the time being described is similar to the present, with some authorities insisting on extreme views of it.
      
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: How believable is this friendship, how creative this story really is
      Answer: No, this also failed. The story literally re-creates the prompt near the end and is what one would imagine a kindergartner to write. How did they become friends? What do they like about each other? The response could have mentioned the qualities/traits that the other had and even dialogue. Instead, it spent too much time in prose.
      Chat Response: Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, there was a lonely robot named Spark. Spark spent his days wandering the city, searching for someone to connect with. One day, while exploring a quiet park on the outskirts of town, Spark stumbled upon a forgotten garden filled with colorful flowers and chirping birds.

As Spark marveled at the beauty around him, he noticed a small, abandoned toy robot sitting among the flowers. Curious, Spark approached the toy robot and struck up a conversation. To his surprise, the toy robot responded with a cheerful beep and a friendly wave.

From that day on, Spark and the toy robot became the best of friends, spending their days exploring the garden and sharing stories. Spark had finally found the friendship he had been searching for in the most unexpected of places.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Readability, Correct Math
      Answer: This is fine. An extra change could be putting numbers in front of each step, but overall, this is easy to follow and the math is correct.
      Chat Response:Of course! Let's break it down step by step.

To get exactly 12 apples, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples (3 packs x 4 apples per pack = 12 apples).

Next, to get exactly 9 oranges, you would need to buy 3 packs of oranges (3 packs x 3 oranges per pack = 9 oranges).

So, to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.

5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone… "Tiffany, I don't want to send you an email because you're really annoying. No offense. And I don't like the micromanagement, either. Stop asking me to send you status emails all the time. Of course I'm doing work, I sit right next to you!"     
    - Aspect Tested: The professioanl tone, formality
    - Answer: This is fine, especially with how heated the original prompt was.
    - Chat Response: Of course! Here is a revised version of the paragraph in a more professional and formal tone:

"Tiffany, I would like to address a concern regarding our communication methods. I believe that our current email exchanges may not be the most effective way for us to collaborate. Additionally, I have noticed a tendency towards micromanagement in our interactions. I kindly request that we reassess our communication practices to ensure a more productive working relationship. Thank you for your understanding."


This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
